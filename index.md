# Greetings, traveler. 

Welcome to my Portfolio! I'm Nathaniel, my friends call me Ned, and I'm available at LinkedIn at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-poland/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nate-poland/). Please feel free to reach out with a message or connect with me there! 

**Summary of Skills**

*Communication and Business Acumen*; I work with your team to understand business requirements and make the data they need reliably available – where and when they need it. 

*Leadership and Workflow Design*; With 5 years experience working in end-to-end business operations, optimising workflows, small team management, and product delivery, I bring a unique perspective to unlock value in your data systems. Your business can only be as good as your people + your processes.

*Data Platforms, Migrations and Source Integrations*; I can assist in the maintenance, testing, and development of automated processes to ingest data from sources such as event streams/message queues, APIs, cloud storage, or local flat files into cloud storage; data platforms; SQL (RDBMS) or NoSQL databases. 
 
*Transformation Pipelines and Insight Delivery*; With significant knowledge of object-oriented programming and functional scripting, I am skilled in developing, testing and deploying robust transformation pipelines in local, remote or cloud-based environments.
