# Greetings, traveler. 

Welcome to my Portfolio! Sorry about the mess -- we're under construction. 

## Intro: about the process
The bootcamp experience was intense, and I learned so much about different `machine learning modelling techniques`. 

I'm excited to learn more about ML, but **in the past five months I've been focused on developing my skills as a Python programmer; as well as learning critical infrastructure rules like version control with Git, file systems, and remote environments and servers.**

My work this past fall took me down a road of learning in this new, invisible world of programming and data:

	- to explore defining `functions`;
		- using (batch) `json` API requests
		- conditional logic

	- through dynamic programming algorithms;
		- function `wrappers`
		- `memoization` and `tabulation`

	- through to developing my own `class` objects
		- with `@property` and `@[property].setter` function wrappers
		- `__init__, __repr__, __new__,` (more to go, here!)

	- to eventually deploying my own Main() class as a script, on a `Heroku` server using `streamlit`.
		- developed my own package
		- Heroku campaign app here : [https://dunnhumby-app.herokuapp.com/](https://dunnhumby-app.herokuapp.com/)

I'm not all the way there yet, that's for dang sure, but I'm excited to earn an opportunity to learn from others in this fast-growing field.
I know that data-based technologies will have a massive impact on the future, and, well -- I just love learning about stuff; languages and math, for one. 

Recognizing the underlying mathematical distributions of real-world events is one thing; capturing them as data is something altogether different. Representing those distributions and using them to empower others in our community -- I believe that that is where the true value of data-based technologies will eventually be realized. 

## Next Steps:
- Automate model fit/test/eval for `Capstone-Rework`
- showcase some of my past work in SQL, using S3 buckets or etc. and develop new ETL systems based in SQL.

# CAPSTONE REWORK - THE COMPLETE JOURNEY [https://github.com/np1919/Capstone-Rework](https://github.com/np1919/Capstone-Rework)
 - developing my own Python package for ETL; 
 - a rudimentary RecommenderSystem class object; 
 - publishing a clean-data sales analysis of the products in 30 distinct advertising campaigns (before, during, and after), on Heroku using streamlit. 
 
 This rework is a huge project (to my experience thus far!), so if you're interested; please check it out. It's a WIP so that's all I'll say here. 

# FUNCTIONS for stock analysis
- json API batch requests 
- trend-reversal function
- conditional logic 

No-commission trading apps were coming in vogue before the beginning of the pandemic, and have been mainstream since. It was an easy jump, when the course finished, to try to apply what I had been learning to stock data.

I actually wanted to learn more about timeseries -- maybe beat the market just a bit, right? but when I got to tensorflow, I realized that my technical knowledge needed to improve in order to get the most from that time -- even from a high level. This notebook is a conglomeration of functions, some more useful than others, which were the results of my work. 

# 
I'm excited to learn more about window-related time-series modelling, but when I started defining how to make my own windows, I knew I had gone too far. There are platforms and packages which people far smarter than me have set up to perform precisely those tasks -- I just needed to learn how to use them effectively. 

# ALGORITHMS - DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
- function wrapper
- _\_default__ dict(); the unbound `class` definition (?)
- big O notation; `time` and `space` complexity of computation.
    
This is a freecodecamp video available on youtube which I actually started working on to prepare for the bootcamp. Having some background Python knowledge allowed me to see so much potential (for iteration) in the simple model codes -- that we were exposed to (in terms of logistic and linear regression, at least). With my new knowledge of pandas and numpy, the tabulation section was a breeze.

- **WIP: `graph algorithms` with `queues` and `stacks`**
    - node structure using simple dictionaries 

# class OBJECTS AND INHERITANCE; portfolio, holdings, and option-contract objects
- leveraging yfinance to populate options spreads
- attempts at inheritance-based class definitions, evnetually using properties
- callable plotting functionality

Having learned a little bit about functions, I tried to apply that knowledge to some sort of inherited `class` structure; in this case, a [ strategy ]Portfolio creating ->[ STOCK ]Holdings objects -> [ STOCK ]Option Contracts. I still have a lot to learn about types and instances; polymorphism and inheritance; but I feel I made a good start with this work -- it uses @property decorators and @[ property].setters.
